# hello-world

Greetings all!

I'm Mark, and working on wrapping up my M.S. in computer science in the next year! My focus is on Artificial Intelligence. I figure SkyNet's coming anyway, so might as well be one of its creators! Outside of A.I., I've done a lot of course work in software engineering utilizing Java, C#, and C++ languages. Hobbies including trying to not die too young (nutrition and exercise), exercising my imagination (reading and video games), and spending time with people who don't want to kill me (wife, dog, friends/family).
